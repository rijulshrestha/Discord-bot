Hi guys! This is just a simple discord bot source code. This bot does not have many features but I hope to add more in the near future. 
The prefix for the bot is "." and type ".help" to list the commands available.
Note that you have to put your discord bot token in the "token" variable on "bot.py" file in order for the bot to work.
